What is DevOps
########################################
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to 
deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations 
using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. 
This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.  (201) 484-7811
